        <p>Yuji Itadori is an unnaturally fit high school student living in Sendai. On his deathbed, his grandfather instils two powerful messages within Yuji: "always help others" and "die surrounded by people." Yuji's friends at the Occult Club attract Curses to their school when they unseal a rotten finger talisman. Yuji swallows the finger to protect Jujutsu Sorcerer Megumi Fushiguro, becoming host to a powerful Curse named Ryomen Sukuna. Due to Sukuna's evil nature, all sorcerers are required to exorcise him (and, by extension, Yuji) immediately. However upon seeing Yuji retaining control over his body, Megumi's teacher Satoru Gojo brings him to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School with a proposal to his superiors: postpone Yuji's death sentence and train under Gojo until he consumes all 20 of Sukuna's fingers so the Curse can be eliminated. At the same time, a group of Cursed Spirits plot a multi-layered attack on the world of Jujutsu sorcery, including the Cursed Spirit Mahito and a corrupted sorcerer named Suguru Geto, who was executed by Gojo a year prior.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Gojo partners Yuji and Megumi with fellow first-year Tokyo student Nobara Kugisaki training them to become sorcerers, but during a mission gone wrong, Sukuna gains full control of Yuji's body, so Yuji allows the both of them to die. Despite this, Sukuna brings Yuji back to life, having grown an interest in Megumi. Aware the Jujutsu high-ups intend to kill Yuji, Gojo keeps his resurrection a secret to continue training him. Yuji meets fellow student Junpei Yoshino, who falls victim to Mahito's manipulations, leading Yuji to swear vengeance.</p>
        <br>
        <p> Gojo reveals Yuji being alive during the exchange event between the Tokyo and Kyoto Jujutsu schools. The Kyoto school's principal wants Yuji dead immediately so schemes to get it done, while the Tokyo students help him. During the event, Cursed Spirits attack the schools, but are fought off by Yuji, Gojo, and third-year Kyoto student Aoi Todo, though Mahito steals three "Death Paintings" (half-human half-Curses), and summons them.</p>

        <p>Yuji Itadori (虎杖 悠仁, Itadori Yūji) is an athletic teenager who joins his school's Occult Club to avoid the track team. After finding and opening a box containing a cursed charm resembling a rotting finger, his school is attacked by phantom-like creatures called Curses. To protect his friends, he consumes the rotting finger and becomes possessed by a Curse known as Ryoumen Sukuna. Yuji later joins the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School under the tutelage of Satoru Gojo, where he is placed under a death sentence, suspended until he consumes all of Sukuna's fingers, after which the execution would be carried out to eliminate Sukuna at the same time. Yuji believes in leading everyone to a proper death and wants to save everyone. Yuji feels responsible for the hundreds of thousands of people Sukuna kills at Shibuya and seeks to stop Kenjaku at all costs.</p>

        <p>Megumi Fushiguro (伏黒 恵, Fushiguro Megumi) is a sorcerer studying in the first year at the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School under the tutelage of Gojo. He meets Yuji when trying to locate a high-grade cursed charm talisman at his high school. Megumi is the one that convinces Satoru to try to save Yuji from his execution after his possession by Sukuna. Megumi possesses the "Ten Shadows Technique" (十種影法術, Tokusa no Kage Bōjutsu). He uses his curse power to create spirits (式神, Shikigami) out of his own shadows to exorcise Curses. He has been noted to have high potential as a sorcerer by several other powerful people, including Sukuna himself. He was originally going to be sold to the Zenin clan (one of the big three prestigious families of sorcerers), which was stopped by Gojo, and thus Megumi became a sorcerer himself.</p>

        <p>Nobara Kugisaki (釘崎 野薔薇, Kugisaki Nobara) is a sorcerer studying in the first year at the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School under the tutelage of Gojo. Nobara transferred to the college so that she could move from the countryside without any expenses. She meets Yuji and Megumi during her first official mission as a sorcerer. Nobara possesses the "Straw Doll Technique" (芻霊呪法, Sūrei Juhō). She carries a toolkit consisting of a strawdoll, a weapon hammer and nails as her primary choice of combat. Nobara looks up to a person called Saori who lived in their village and wishes to meet her sometime again.

        <p>Satoru Gojo (五条 悟, Gojō Satoru) is a sorcerer working as a teacher at the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School. He uses his curse power to control the space around him in numerous ways. Even though his title of 'The Strongest' is self-proclaimed, most allies and enemies alike never actually dispute the title and consider him one of the most dangerous people alive. As a result, Satoru is widely respected by sorcerers and greatly influences the sorcery world. He convinces his superiors at the college to keep Yuji Itadori alive until he consumes all of Sukuna's fingers. He teaches Yuji, Megumi Fushiguro, and Nobara Kugisaki. The Special Grade Cursed Spirits ambushed him at Shibuya, and Kenjaku managed to seal him away after he exorcised Hanami. Towards the end of the Culling Games, his students successfully release him from the Prison Realm and he immediately challenges Megumi, Sukuna's current host to a duel on Christmas Eve.
